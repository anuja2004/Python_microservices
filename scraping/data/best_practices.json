    "url": "https://nwm.gov.in/enhancing-water-storage-capacity-minor-irrigation-tanks-yadgir-karnataka",
    "content": "Interventions: \n\n5. Strategies and Approaches. Yadgir, a district in the Indian state of Karnataka, is known for its numerous tanks or artificial reservoirs that play a crucial role in soil fertility, irrigation, water supply, and groundwater recharge. However, Yadgir and Gurmitkal Blocks have 72 Minor irrigation tanks that provide Net irrigation of 3239 Ha. and 160 private small tanks that provide net irrigation of 1073 Hectares, over time, these tanks accumulate silt, leading to reduced water storage capacity, and decreased efficiency in water distribution, and increased risk of flooding during monsoon seasons. Effective desilting of these tanks is essential to restore their functionality and ensure sustainable water management in the region. After evaluating the technical feasibility assessment by experts, the team organised Gram Sabha to get people's approval for the de-silting of tanks and farmers ready to apply the silt to their lands. The team identified the community need by conducting numerous community-level meetings and taking into consideration the experience of the Minor Irrigation Department. The team identified tanks in Pasppol, Azalapur, and Karanagi. We established and strengthened the Village Water and Sanitation Committee (VWSC) to oversee activities and choose vendors. With the help of farmers, VWSC, and the Gram Panchayat, work was started. Positive energy has been created in the community by this intervention. After initiating the Paspool New Tank community came forward and requested us to start one more tank in the same village and we considered and started de-silting work in the Paspool old tank.\n\nTheme: \nRevival of Traditional Water Bodies\nPlace of implementation: \nYadgir, Karnataka\nOrganisation / Department: \nKalike-Tata Trusts\nYear of implementation: \n2024\nBackground: \n\n1. Introduction. Yadgir, a rural district nestled in the heart of Karnataka, India, grapples with the perpetual challenge of water scarcity, a concern exacerbated by erratic rainfall patterns and depleting water resources. One of the region's time-honoured solutions, tank desilting, has emerged as a promising intervention to rejuvenate water bodies and mitigate the impact of droughts. This article delves into the significance of tank desilting in rural Yadgir and its implications for sustainable water management. Tank silt is a fine soil particle transported from the catchment area through surface runoff and soil erosion along with crop debris and deposited as sediment in the water spread area of the tanks constructed for rainwater harvest. These sediments when decomposed over the period become nutrient-rich soil amendments loaded with organic matter with good physical properties. Nutrient flow in the undulated plains or watersheds; especially the leaching of soil nutrients along the water stream and accumulation in natural or manmade barriers such as tanks, ponds, ditches, lakes, and rivers is a well-documented phenomenon. Agricultural lands form a major part of the catchment areas and contribute to the tanks' rainwater storage. Intermittent and high-intensity rainfall during the monsoons causes heavy surface runoff and erosion of valuable nutrient-rich topsoil from the surrounding agricultural lands. Siltation adversely affects the storage capacity of tanks in the long run. Hence, for the conservation and rehabilitation of traditional water tanks desilting is necessary which enables collecting and storing enough water for agriculture and the effective utilization of silt as a soil amendment in agricultural lands. 2. Understanding the Context. Yadgir, characterized by its predominantly agrarian economy, heavily relies on rain-fed agriculture for sustenance. However, recurrent droughts and inadequate water infrastructure have perpetuated the cycle of poverty and vulnerability among its populace. The degradation of traditional water storage systems, such as tanks due to silt accumulation, has further compounded the region's water woes, leaving communities parched and agricultural lands barren. Crop and irrigation practices: About 75% of the geographical area of the district is under cultivation. Irrigation through dug wells is more prevalent in Yadgir taluk, whereas irrigation in Shorapur and Shahpur taluks is through the canal of the Upper Krishna Project. Lift Irrigation Schemes are under implementation along the Bhima River. The crops cultivated in the district are mainly rainfed. The major crops of the district are Jowar, Bajra, Gram, Tur, Groundnut, Sunflower, and Sugarcane. The irrigated crops are rice, wheat, and sugarcane. Yadgir's geographical setting plays a critical role in its water security challenges. The district is characterized by undulating terrain, shallow soil cover, and limited surface water resources. Moreover, Yadgir is predominantly dependent on rain-fed agriculture, making it particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall patterns. Seasonal Groundwater Fluctuation: After seasonal rainfall, the groundwater level records a rise, indicating recharge to groundwater. During the pre-monsoon period, there was a depletion of groundwater level due to exploitation, natural discharge, and no recharge. This is manifested as a fall in groundwater level during the pre-monsoon period. Historically, Yadgir has relied on traditional water management systems such as tanks, reservoirs, and check dams to harness rainwater and sustain agriculture. However, these systems have suffered from neglect, siltation, and insufficient maintenance over time, compromising their effectiveness in water storage and recharge. Climate change has intensified the challenges of water security in Yadgir. Erratic rainfall patterns, prolonged droughts, and extreme weather events have become more frequent, disrupting agricultural cycles and exacerbating water scarcity. The district's vulnerability to climate change underscores the urgent need for adaptive measures to enhance resilience. Excessive extraction of groundwater for irrigation and drinking water purposes has led to the depletion of aquifers in Yadgir. Unregulated extraction practices, coupled with inadequate recharge mechanisms, have contributed to the declining groundwater levels, posing long-term sustainability challenges. Institutional and governance factors also influence water security in Yadgir. Limited coordination among government agencies, lack of community participation in water management initiatives, and inadequate infrastructure pose barriers to effective water governance and resource management. Water scarcity has profound socio-economic implications for the residents of Yadgir. Reduced agricultural productivity, livelihood insecurity, migration, and conflicts over water access are some of the consequences faced by communities grappling with water stress. Addressing the water security challenges in Yadgir requires a multi-faceted approach encompassing sustainable water management practices, watershed conservation measures, promotion of water-efficient technologies, community engagement, and policy interventions. By adopting a holistic and participatory approach, stakeholders can work towards ensuring water security for present and future generations in Yadgir. Groundwater-related issues and problems: In the Yadgir district, variable stages of groundwater development are noticed as per the March 2017 estimations. In Yadgir taluk the stage of groundwater extraction is 79 %, wherein it requires a suitable management plan to arrest further deterioration of the groundwater. The quality of groundwater in the district in general is good and potable. However, EC and fluoride, nitrate and arsenic concentrations beyond permissible limits have been found to occur in a few samples collected from all three taluks. Yadgir district is one of the aspirational districts identified in Karnataka State which is affected by poor socio-economic indicators. Scientific development on all fronts including the water sector in the district can lead to the overall improvement in the socio-economic conditions in the district. As the Yadgir taluk is semi-critical, recharging the dry phreatic aquifer through artificial recharge structures, like check dams, percolation tanks etc. is recommended. 3. The Role of Tank Desilting. The application of tank silt, also known as tank silt manure or tank silt compost, involves utilizing the nutrient-rich sediment extracted during tank desilting operations as organic fertilizer or soil amendment in agriculture. Tank silt application is a sustainable practice that not only helps in managing sediment accumulation in water bodies but also enhances soil fertility, improves crop productivity, and promotes ecological balance. The first step in tank silt application is the collection of sediment from the bottom of tanks or reservoirs during desilting operations. Sediment may contain organic matter, nutrients, and beneficial microorganisms that are valuable for soil health and plant growth. In this dire scenario, tank desilting emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution to enhance water availability. Desilting involves the removal of accumulated silt and debris from the tank beds, thereby increasing their storage capacity and reinvigorating groundwater recharge. This process not only augments water retention but also mitigates the risk of flooding during monsoons, fostering resilience against climate-induced disasters. Tank desilting plays a crucial role in addressing water scarcity and promoting sustainable water management practices in Yadgir, Karnataka. This intervention involves the removal of accumulated silt and debris from tanks in traditional water storage systems prevalent in the region. Soil Health Benefits: Tank silt application improves soil health by increasing microbial activity, enhancing soil biodiversity, and stimulating nutrient cycling processes. The organic matter in the silt acts as a natural soil conditioner, replenishing soil organic carbon and improving soil tilth. Healthy soils support vigorous plant growth and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and chemical inputs. Nutrient Contribution: Tank silt serves as a valuable source of nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients, which are essential for plant growth. The organic matter present in the silt improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, thereby enhancing soil fertility and promoting healthy root development. Crop Yield and Quality: Incorporating tank silt into agricultural soils can lead to significant improvements in crop yield and quality. The balanced nutrient composition of the silt promotes vigorous vegetative growth, flowering, and fruit set, resulting in higher yields and better-quality produce. Additionally, crops grown in silt-amended soils may exhibit increased resistance to pests, diseases, and environmental stresses. Water Storage Capacity Enhancement: Over time, tanks in Yadgir accumulate sediment and silt, reducing their storage capacity and impeding water retention. Desilting removes these obstructions, allowing tanks to regain their original storage capacity and better capture rainwater during monsoon seasons. This increased storage capacity helps mitigate water scarcity during dry periods and ensures a more reliable water supply for agricultural and domestic use. Groundwater Recharge: Desilted tanks facilitate groundwater recharge by allowing rainwater to percolate into the underlying aquifers. In a region heavily dependent on groundwater for irrigation and drinking water, enhanced recharge from de-silted tanks can help replenish depleted aquifers and sustain water availability over the long term. Flood Control: Besides mitigating water scarcity, tank desilting also contributes to flood control efforts. During heavy rainfall events, de-silted tanks can absorb excess runoff and prevent flooding in downstream areas. By acting as natural water retention structures, these tanks help in managing water flows and reduce the risk of flood-related disasters. Socio-economic Benefits: Tank desilting initiatives in Yadgir generate socio-economic benefits for local communities. Additionally, improved water availability resulting from desilting enhances agricultural productivity, leading to increased crop yields and food security for farming communities. Community Participation and Ownership: Community engagement fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility towards water resources, encouraging sustainable management practices and ensuring the long-term viability of de-silted tanks. Climate Resilience: In the face of climate change and increasing variability in rainfall patterns, de-silted tanks contribute to enhancing the resilience of communities in Yadgir. By maximizing water storage and recharge capacity, these tanks help buffer the impacts of droughts and water shortages, thereby building resilience to climate-related challenges. Traditional Knowledge and Practices: Local communities in Yadgir often possess valuable traditional knowledge and practices related to water management. Through participatory approaches, such as community meetings, workshops, and knowledge-sharing sessions, these indigenous practices can be integrated into desilting projects. Leveraging traditional wisdom enhances the effectiveness and sustainability of interventions by aligning them with local socio-cultural contexts and ecological dynamics. Employment and Livelihood Opportunities: Tank desilting projects create employment and livelihood opportunities for community members, particularly for marginalized groups such as landless labourers and women. Participating in desilting activities, such as manual labour, machinery operation, and project supervision, enables individuals to earn income and improve their economic well-being. This contributes to poverty alleviation and enhances the socio-economic resilience of communities in Yadgir. Environmental Conservation: Communities' participation in tank desilting contributes to environmental conservation by restoring ecological functions, promoting sustainable water management, enhancing biodiversity, improving soil fertility, and mitigating climate change. In summary, community participation is integral to the success and impact of tank desilting interventions in Yadgir, Karnataka. By engaging local communities as active partners in water management initiatives, these interventions not only address immediate water scarcity issues but also foster sustainable development, empower marginalized groups, and promote environmental stewardship in the region.\n\nObjectives: \n\nTo improve soil fertility by enriching it with organic matter, nutrients, and beneficial microorganisms present in tank silt and enhance crop productivity in Yadgir Karnataka. To enhance water storage capacity by de-silting the existing tanks in Yadgir, Karnataka, by participatory approach.\n\nOutcome: \n\nAchievement. The data reflects the impact of silt application across four tanks: Paspool Old Tank, Paspool New Tank, Azalapur Tank, and Karanagi Tank. The Paspool Old Tank created a storage capacity of 6,684.32 cubic meters, benefiting 79 farmers, with 3,838 silt trips transported to cover 149.4 acres, and a community contribution amounting to ₹11,51,400. Similarly, the Paspool New Tank developed a capacity of 7,552.66 cubic meters, aiding 47 farmers through 2,419 silt trips across 88.9 acres, with a community contribution of ₹7,25,700. Azalapur Tank contributed a storage of 13,179.89 cubic meters, benefiting 45 farmers, transporting 4,515 silt trips to cover 179.14 acres, with ₹11,28,750 contributed by the community. Lastly, the Karanagi Tank added a storage of 6,673.08 cubic meters, supporting 38 farmers with 3,013 silt trips for 118.79 acres, and a community contribution of ₹12,05,200. In total, the four tanks created a storage capacity of 34,089.95 cubic meters, benefiting 209 farmers with 13,785 silt trips across 536.23 acres, and a collective community contribution of ₹42,11,050. Tank Desilting Storage capacity enhancement details The TAML Tank Desilting Storage Capacity Enhancement project covers tanks in four villages: Azalapur, Karanagi, and Paspool. In Azalapur, the Azalapur Tank has a catchment area of 22.01 square kilometres with a live storage capacity of 78.1 million cubic feet (Mcft) and water spreading over 110 hectares. Desilting has created an additional capacity of 13,179.89 cubic meters (or 0.465 Mcft), bringing the total capacity to 78.565 Mcft. In Karanagi, the Karanagi Tank Desilting work spans a catchment area of 4.6 square kilometres, with an original live capacity of 27.52 Mcft. The desilting process added 6,673.08 cubic meters (0.236 Mcft), resulting in a new total capacity of 27.756 Mcft and an expanded water spread area of 38.97 hectares. For Paspool, two tanks were improved. The Paspool New Tank has an 8.54 square kilometre catchment area, holding an original live capacity of 23.19 Mcft. Desilting added 7,552.66 cubic meters (0.266 Mcft) for a total capacity of 23.456 Mcft and a water spread of 35.3 hectares. The Paspool Old Tank, with a catchment area of 1.6 square kilometers, initially had a live capacity of 6.76 Mcft. An additional 6,684.32 cubic meters (0.236 Mcft) was created, resulting in a new total capacity of 6.996 Mcft and an extended water spread of 12.76 hectares. Across all four tanks, the total additional capacity created is 1.203 Mcft, enhancing water availability and storage significantly for the region.\n\nInnovation: \n\nPromoting sustainable agricultural practices is another key objective. By utilising locally available resources like tank silt instead of relying solely on chemical fertilisers, farmers can reduce input costs, minimize environmental degradation, maintain long-term soil health, and aim to increase crop yields by providing essential nutrients and improving soil structure, which can support healthier plant growth, better root development, and enhanced resistance to pests and diseases. Tank desilting is a crucial measure for addressing water scarcity and promoting resilience in rural Yadgir, Karnataka. By engaging communities in the decision-making process and adopting innovative solutions, stakeholders can establish a sustainable path towards water security. This will empower vulnerable populations and preserve the region's ecological heritage for future generations. In conclusion, through collective wisdom and commitment, we can ensure that these efforts contribute to a brighter and more sustainable future for all. After the intervention, we discovered that there is a significant need for increasing storage capacity and improving water security. The farmers were in dire need of fertile silt, and we were able to generate 34089.95 cubic metres of it. The community spent around ₹42,11,050 on the transportation of the silt.",

    "content": "Interventions: \n\nBased on the above-mentioned objectives, inventions were targeted for efficient coordination between schemes and departments and their effective execution. With the cooperation of public representatives and members of Panchayati Raj Institutions, 75 Amrit Sarovars in the district were identified for renovation. Two active Panchayat Level Officers and Panchayat representatives were identified and appointed to monitor the work under development of each Amritsar Sarovar. Here, the focus was not only on earthworks and making Amrit Sarovar encroachment free, but also on developing them as a center of celebration and recreational activities for concerned Gram Panchayat. Beautification of Amrit Sarovar banks was ensured, flag hoisting posts were erected, and open gyms and nurseries were developed around them. Hence efforts were made to develop a recreational ecosystem around these traditional pokhars to help local people appreciate its importance as well as integrate these pokhars in their daily lives.\n\nThe Minor Water Resource Department has revived several Pokhars of the area of more than……hectare and rejuvenated many Ahar and Pynes. For example, Chanda Pokkhar in Henva village of Chakki Block is rejuvenated by constructing a step protection wall of 114 meters and providing five numbers of outlets. In the process of rejuvenating Dalsagar Pokhar in Buxar Block, a total of 64849 cubic meters of earthwork has been done along with the construction of two inlets. Similarly, Mogasi Pokhar in Dumraon, Hethua Ahar and Pynes in Rajpur, Chillhar and Basav Narayanpur Ahar and Pynes in Itarhi, and Pipararh Ahar and Pynes in Brahmpur were rejuvenated.\n\nMany plantation drives by the MGNREGA Scheme, Jeevika Didis, and Forest departments led to the plantation of saplings around Amrit Sarovar and Ahar-Pynes. This helped in checking encroachments and strengthening their embankments. Under National Innovation on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA), demonstration of water conservation techniques in agriculture, like digging of farm ponds of different dimensions by farmers, have benefitted them as well as rejuvenated many old ponds. Adopting the profession of fishing, Jeevika Didis has also revived many dying ponds. They ensured regular cleaning, reporting, and checking encroachments and also introduced fishlings and water nutrients to keep ponds ecologically vibrant. In Chausa Block, the Nikrish Pump House Project is in progress, which will help in improving the availability of water at the tail end of the Chausa Branch Canal and hence rejuvenate connected Ahar and Pynes.\n\nTheme: \nRevival of Traditional Water Bodies\nPlace of implementation: \nDistrict - Buxar, State - Bihar\nOrganisation / Department: \nThe Office of the District Magistrate, district - Buxar, Government of Bihar\nYear of implementation: \n2023\nBackground: \n\nBuxar is endowed with several traditional water bodies ranging from Ponds to Ahars and Pynes. Along with them, it has a good stretch of the Ganga River as its northern boundary, and Kav River naturally feeds many traditional water bodies. However, these traditional water bodies are generally neglected as they require the integration of efforts of many concerned departments for their rejuvenation and maintenance. Many Ponds, Ahars and Pynes are completely encroached upon by local people. Many ponds are either completely concretized or choked by garbage or sewage. Many Ahars and Pynes are not regularly cleaned and dug, leading to flooding and wastage of surplus water in monsoon. This negligence leads to water logging, poor water table recharge, wastage of rainwater, inequitable access to irrigation water, etc. Hence, now the need of the hour was to understand these humongous challenges and simultaneously convert challenging situations into opportunities of mission-mode multidimensional efforts towards revival of these efforts. Different schemes and concerned departments help in reviving traditional water bodies directly or indirectly. So, in this background, five major departments or schemes were identified which were Amrit Sarovar Scheme, National Mission for Clean Ganga, Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Mission, Minor Water Resources Department, and MGNREG Scheme. Along with these five pillars, other efforts were also synchronized like initiatives of the Soil Conservation Department, Krishi Vigyan Kendras, etc for the revival of traditional water bodies.\n\nObjectives: \n\nThe ultimate objective through the revival of traditional water bodies efforts is to regain the vitality of a network of water bodies that have supported the water needs of Buxar for hundreds of years. The revival of these traditional water bodies will create a strong foundation to fulfill the needs of future generations. These efforts will further help in groundwater recharge, improvement in soil moisture content, availability of surplus water for irrigation, in rain deficit season, equitable distribution of water, etc. Hence, directly and indirectly, resolving other grave issues like poor agricultural productivity and intensity, topsoil erosion, and depletion of groundwater. Here, therefore, the objective was to bring those schemes and departments to a table that would bring significant and multidimensional results in the revival of traditional water bodies at large. The collaboration between the Amrit Sarovar Scheme, National Mission for Clean Ganga, Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Mission, Minor Water Resources Department, and MGNREG Scheme would amplify positive changes in many folds.\n\nThe Amrit Sarovar Mission targeted to development of at least 75 Amrit Sarovars in the district. The pond area of each Amrit Sarovar had to be at least one acre, which will have a water holding capacity of about 10,000 cubic meters. National Mission for Clean Ganga helps in reviving the sanctity and purity of Ganga as well as its unhindered flow (aviral dhara). The ecologically balanced flow and river bed of Ganga support the water table of nearby traditional water bodies. Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Mission of the Bihar Government has a water component at its core where it integrates fifteen departments to conserve water bodies hence subsequently promoting the significance of the Trinity of Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali in human life. The Minor Water Resource Department aims at rejuvenating big water bodies and Ahar & Pynes. MGNREG Scheme has earthwork like digging and strengthening of soil embankments as its salient feature, hence helping in rejuvenating small river Kav as well ponds, Ahar, and Pynes.\n\nOutcome: \n\nThe collaborative efforts of concerned departments have received traditional water bodies at a large scale. A total of 76 Amrit Sarovar developed, and their rejuvenation helped in increasing its water-holding capacity significantly. This also helped in improving the groundwater table of the nearby region and hence helped in the revival of old wells. The water in these ponds is used by farmers at some places for irrigation of cultivated land. Proper maintenance and beautification of Amrit Sarovars have led them to become centers of recreation. People, influenced by the doctors and Yog guru, are enjoying morning walks and yoga sessions around Amrit Sarovar banks. Hence these traditional water bodies have proved themselves as essential natural assets for concerned Gram Panchayats.\n\nUnder the Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Mission, the State government ranks all 38 districts based on their performance on different parameters, and here Buxar stands at first position in the whole state by putting special focus on the development and regeneration of water bodies. A total of 543 ponds (Pokharas), 680 Ahars, and 3382 Pynes are revived. It has created a strong network of revived traditional water bodies across Buxar. Under NICRA, the demonstration of rainwater harvesting structures (farm ponds) has encouraged 55 farmers who have developed farm ponds of different dimensions with a 27.8-hectare total area and 161 lakh liters of water storage capacity.\n\nThe Minor Water Resource Department has revived several Pokhars and rejuvenated many Ahars and Pynes. which improved the equitable distribution of water across agricultural fields and the availability of water for irrigation in the sowing period of the Rabi season. National Mission for Clean Ganga’ checked pollution in Ganga and the cleanliness of Ganga Ghats. With the huge and integrated efforts in Nawanagar and Dumraon blocks, under the MGNREGA Scheme, the Kav River is revived. The earthworks in the MGNREGA Scheme have rejuvenated several small ponds, Ahars, and Pynes and also strengthened its boundaries.\n\nInnovation: \n\nThe innovative intent in the revival of traditional water bodies demanded preserving the sanctity of these water bodies through minimal disturbance in their ecology and bringing back them at the center of people’s daily lives. Through the engineering assistance of the Minor Water Resource Department and NICRA traditional Pokhara and Ahars-Pynes were rejuvenated. Active participation of people and their representatives was ensured to make these water bodies lively places. Relevant efforts of other departments were converged to revive these water bodies.",

    "content": "Interventions: \n\nUnder the National Mission for Clean Ganga, different initiatives are encouraged to inform people to keep the Ganga and its surroundings clean. Volunteers from the locality are identified and encouraged to make Ganga ghats clean and plastic-free. Cleanliness drives, oath-taking programs and rallies are arranged in Ganga villages to attract many people to the cause. Boat races and different sports activities are organized along Ganga ghat to convey the message of Ganga cleanliness among youth and local people. During Chhat and other big congregations at Ganga Ghats, boats are deployed with personnel to communicate the message of the cleanliness of the river and ghat. and Dustbins are kept along the Ganga River in Simri block. Ratri-Chaupal and Mashal yatra are organized to encourage personal connection with the Ganga River and discuss local initiatives to keep the Ganga clean. NCC cadets, school and college students are engaged in painting competitions and seminars to create awareness among young minds. Catch the Rain program is promoted for rainwater harvesting. Water conservation is an important topic of Weekly Group discussions organized by Jeevika Didis. Few Self Help Groups are taking care of ponds by adopting the profession of fishing. They regularly clean it, report and check encroachments and also introduce fishlings and water nutrients to keep ponds ecologically vibrant. Jeevika Didis has also established plant nurseries and is playing a vital role in taking the message of water conservation and afforestation to the last mile. In another effort, 1.5 lakh fishlings were introduced in the Ganga River to support the livelihoods of many poor as well as check pollution in the River.\n\nThe Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Mission of Bihar Government keeps water resource conservation initiatives at its core. Buxar stands at second/ first position in the whole state by putting a special focus on the development and regeneration of water bodies. The awareness component of this Mission has brought every concerned department to one table where they decided to integrate their efforts to bring a tangible change in water bodies. This Mission makes people aware of the indispensability of the Trinity of Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali in their lives.\n\nAfter its rejuvenation under the MGNREGA Scheme, the micro-irrigation department and soil conservation department encouraged people to plant saplings along Ahar-Pynes and ponds boundaries to strengthen its boundaries, which further helps in the percolation of water and groundwater recharge. Krishi Vigyan Kendras is encouraging farmers to adopt organic farming to minimize water pollution and water use. The Soil Conservation Department has made many farmers aware of the importance of rainwater harvesting and optimal use of water resources through Nukkad-Natak, slogan writing and wall paintings. This department is making Soil Health Cards which reflect the soil moisture content of fields and hence promote farmers towards climate-friendly farming practices. Many farmers learned considerably through the demonstration of water conservation techniques in agriculture under the Climate Resilient Agriculture Programme (CRAP) like zero tillage wheat, alternating drying and wetting in rice, water harvesting structures and field bunding of rice, and direct seeded of rice. Demonstration of water conservation techniques in agriculture, like digging of Farm Ponds of different dimensions by farmers, under the National Innovation on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) have benefitted many farmers. Demonstrations of rainwater harvesting structures (farm ponds) have benefitted 55 farmers who have developed farm ponds of different dimensions with a 27.8-hectare total area and 161 lakh liters of water storage capacity.\n\nTheme: \nAwareness Generation Initiative\nPlace of implementation: \nDistrict - Buxar, State - Bihar\nOrganisation / Department: \nThe Office of the District Magistrate, district - Buxar, Government of Bihar\nYear of implementation: \n2024\nBackground: \n\nBuxar district is blessed with a long stretch of Ganga river and various traditional water bodies like Ahar-Pynes and ponds. Network of these water bodies in the district requires its conservation as well as preservation of its purity and cleanliness in its surroundings. Along the Ganga ghats, lakhs of people come to celebrate many festivals like Chhat, Ganga Dussehra, etc. whole year leading to pollution along the ghats. Ahar-Pynes and ponds are major sources of irrigation in Buxar and their timely rejuvenation makes them viable to hold excess water in monsoon and recharge groundwater. Buxar, which has an agro-based economy, is famous for its Sonachur rice cultivation which is a water-guzzling crop. On-farm misuse of water and wrong choice of crops also lead to water wastage. Hence, here main intervention required is to inform local people about the cruciality of these water bodies in our lives and how their cleanliness and conservation would help in sustainable development. Therefore, a strong apparatus of awareness campaign is needed to engage every section of people benefitting from these water bodies directly or indirectly. Active participation of people is required in the conservation of the sanctity of water bodies to bring sustainable behavior change.\n\nObjectives: \n\nBased on the background given, the aim of the initiative is the convergence of different schemes and departments for creating awareness at a large scale about the conservation and preservation of a huge network of water bodies in Buxar. Convergence of efforts of National Mission for Clean Ganga, PM Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, Krishi Vigyan Kendras, MGNREGA, Panchayati Raj department, forest department, education department, minor irrigation department as well as a huge force of Jeevika Didis. These departments and organizations have regular interaction with farmers, students, women, rural population, etc., who have a heavy dependence on water resources as well as who have the potential to become ambassadors of water conservation. Streamlined efforts of these departments can create ripple effects in society for conservation and wise use of water. Awareness created by them will help local people to ensure cleanliness along Ganga ghats and ponds, keeping Ahar-Pynes encroachment-free, and sustainable use of water in agriculture fields.\n\nOutcome: \n\nThe awareness programmes and different initiatives helped in the active participation of people to understand the importance of water conservation. Proper use of dustbins along Ganga ghat in Simri which helps in controlling pollution of the river. Through the active participation of youth, a cadre of Ganga doots has been strengthened to ensure regular awareness programmes among local people. Forest department has developed Kamaldah Pokhar Park, which has become a tourist spot in Buxar city. A total of 543 pounds (pokhar), 680 Ahars and 3382 Pynes were rejuvenated under the Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Mission in Buxar. Krishi Vigyan Kendras has made 4408 Soil Health Cards. The fisheries department is maintaining the cleanliness of this Pokhara and is hence playing a major role in recharging depleting groundwater levels in urban areas. People are volunteering to maintain the cleanliness of Ganga ghats and ponds. Farmers and poor agriculture laborers are appreciating equitable access to water for irrigating their fields. The rejuvenation of Ahar-Pynes and ponds has helped in strengthening its embankments and increasing the catchment area of water.\n\nInnovation: \n\nThe basic line of thought is to ensure effective and targeted communication of water conservation messages through the active participation of students, farmers, habitants of Ganga villages, Jeevika Didis, etc. Their lives and livelihoods are dependent on water bodies, and they are also worried about the depleting condition of these water resources. Hence any intervention that carries a message of their sustainable future will be hurriedly received by them. Therefore, through different schemes and departments specific groups are targeted to bring behavioural change as well as for bringing changes on the ground. Jal Doots, Jal Kalash Yatras, Mashal yatras, plant adoption by students, etc. efforts are planned to make society more aware of the necessity of the cause. International Yoga Day was celebrated along the clean ghats of Ganga, which conveyed the message of water conservation. Innovative steps are focussing on creating a sense of attachment to water bodies among people so that they can own the responsibility of water conservation. The strength of the community is utilized to bring water to the center of discussion and action. So, regularly nudging people to think about water and its importance will ultimately bring a huge transformation in their actions.",

    "url": "https://nwm.gov.in/multi-stakeholder-initiative-wetland-restoration-improve-health-aril-river",
    "content": "Interventions: \n\nTechnical\n1. WWF-India along with their technical partners (IIT-Kanpur and consultants) conducted a comprehensive assessment of wetlands in the Ramganga basin, including their degradation and groundwater conditions. This analysis led to the prioritization of wetlands for restoration. The Aril River basin was selected as a pilot project for demonstrating river-wetland co-management. A collaborative approach led by the district administration and coordinated by WWF-India has participation from various government departments, the District Ganga Committee, riparian communities and farmers. This joint initiative led to improvement in the ecological health of the river.\n2. Spatio-temporal mapping of the Aril basin indicated that about 60% of wetlands were in a degraded state. Based on the wetland’s status and connectivity to river floodplains, 20 plus wetlands were field surveyed to collect baseline information which indicated that there are several major threats to the wetlands including excess weed growth, siltation, choked inlets/outlets, sewage inflow, fragmentation, intensive chemical usage in agriculture, LULC changes in the catchment, to ownerships.\n3. Using a prioritization matrix three floodplain wetlands were selected viz. Khangawa Shyam (10.6 hectares (ha), Lilaur Lake (42 ha), and Bahoda Kheda (7.42 ha) in Bareilly district for taking up the restoration activities. These wetlands were prioritized based on their ecosystem services and biodiversity values/potential.\n4. Topographic surveys of wetlands and their catchments were also conducted to map catchment characteristics (slope, siltation, volumes, etc)\nMulti-Stakeholder Engagement\n1. Comprehensive baseline surveys were conducted through engagement with riparian communities, and line departments to assess the existing status of the wetlands, including biodiversity, eco-hydrological health, ecosystem services, ownership, management regimes and threats.\n2. A wetland restoration plan was co-developed through engagement and discussions with all key stakeholders, focusing on addressing threats such as degraded inlets/outlets, invasive weeds, catchment fragmentation, pollution, solid waste, and siltation.\n3. A multi-stakeholder approach was adopted, involving the District Administration Bareilly, WWF-India, government departments, representatives from five villages, and over 500 community members under the ‘Aril Mitra platform to spread awareness and enhance community participation in restoration activities.\n4. Community members were trained in sustainable agriculture practices to reduce negative impacts on wetland and river health through improved management practices, reduced chemical inputs, water usage, and adoption of organic inputs in agriculture. Mitras also contributed to restoration activities like channel rehabilitation, de-weeding, and wetland health monitoring.\nInstitutional and governance\n1. The district administration and government departments provided essential administrative support for conservation activities. Synergies were established with government schemes like MNREGA to facilitate restoration efforts, such as desilting and channel rehabilitation.\n2. Eight new inlets were created, and four inlet channels were rehabilitated to improve water flow from the catchment into the wetlands and Aril River. To enhance the ecological health of the wetlands, as a proof-of-concept, water hyacinth removal was conducted in a two-hectare area, where 2500 quintals of wet weed were removed. The deweeded invasives were converted into organic compost for use by local farmers. Several awareness and community mobilization activities were conducted to promote conservation efforts.\n3. As part of impact assessment, the change in wetland’s hydrological and ecological health was monitored, where communities were also trained on monitoring of water quality, and groundwater levels as part of their empowerment through citizen science.\n\nTheme: \nSmall River Rejuvenation Initiative\nPlace of implementation: \nAril river, Bareilly district, Uttar Pradesh\nOrganisation / Department: \nDistrict Administration-Bareilly and WWF-India\nYear of implementation: \n2023\nBackground: \n\nRamganga (a tributary of Ganga River) and its tributaries are aquifer-fed river systems that are being subjected to loss of connectivity and degradation of river health (flows, water quality, biodiversity) due to over-abstraction of groundwater, diversion of surface water, unsustainable agriculture practices, pollution, land use change), encroachment etc. To improve river health, maintaining its 3-dimensional connectivity viz lateral (floodplain), Longitudinal (Upstream to downstream) and vertical (river-groundwater) connectivity is essential. Wetlands are an integral part of the river basin which helps in maintaining its eco-hydrological health. Apart from providing a myriad of ecosystem services to communities and biodiversity, wetlands are crucial in supporting base flows (lean season flows) in the river system through groundwater replenishment and direct connectivity through surface water channels.\nBareilly District Administration along with WWF-India and Aril River Mitras (friends of Aril) has adopted a unique approach to revive the Aril River (right bank tributary of Ramganga River) through river-wetland co-management. As part of this initiative, wetland restoration is done through multi-stakeholder engagement. The Bareilly District Administration and WWF-India have been able to mobilize collective action for wetland conservation by fostering partnerships among various entities, including MNREGA cell, government departments (Revenue, Groundwater, Minor irrigation, etc.), local communities, farmers and technical partners (IIT-Kanpur and consultants),. As part of this initiative, four wetlands with a collective area of over 62 hectares have been rejuvenated. This initiative is aligned with the NMCG’s vision of Aviral and Nirmal Ganga and contributes to the same.\n\nObjectives: \n\nObjectives of this initiative were:\n• Demonstrate river rejuvenation through wetland restoration and monitoring of impacts\n• Collective action on wetland restoration activities\n• Multi-stakeholder engagement and capacity building of stakeholders on river and wetland rejuvenation\n\nOutcome: \n\nThe impacts and benefits of this collective initiative are at multiple levels, including –\nA. Improved Hydrological health of wetlands and enhanced resilience\n• Increase in surface water inflows into the wetland- Post restoration, the three wetlands received additional inflows of 2.7 billion liters (270 crore liters) of additional water between 2022 and 2024) as compared to baseline condition. This not only improved the wetland's health and local water security but also rejuvenated the Aril River by discharging water from the wetland into the Aril River through a connected channel.\n Khangawa Shyam wetland was rejuvenated by 225 million liters (22.5 crores) of additional water from the catchment\n Lilaur Lake was rejuvenated by about 2300 million liters (230 crores) of additional water from the catchment due to restoration activities in contributing channels\n Bahoda Kheda wetland was rejuvenated by an additional 180 million liters (18 crores) of water through new inlets created\nB. Aril River rejuvenated through wetland restoration\n• The health of the Aril River is enhanced, employing enhanced freshwater flows (to the tune of 200 million liters) in the river, through a connected outlet channel from the Khangawa Shyam wetland.\nC. Improved Health of immediate catchment\n• To improve wetland health and promote organic farming in the wetland zone of influence, 2500 quintals of wet weed were removed and turned into 700 quintals of compost, which is being used by farmers in their crops. The compost from hyacinth has 5 times more nitrogen, 10 times more phosphorus and 3 times more potassium in addition to high micronutrients.\n• Apart from this, 500 plus farmers were trained on the preparation and adoption of bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides (Amrit Paani and Amrit Khaad) and followed better management practices in agriculture through customized Package of Practices (PoP). Farmers reported an increase in the length of the wheat spike, improved plant health, saving of 1 watering in wheat crop, and a substantial reduction in chemical inputs, through the adoption of PoP.\n• The increased water availability in wetlands led to an increase in groundwater levels by 4-5 feet thereby improving aquifer health and local water security for communities.\nD. Effective Multi-Stakeholder engagement and governance\nE. Several key stakeholders (District administration, line departments, riparian communities, farmers, experts, etc) were engaged, Synergies with government schemes like MNREGA were built and through leveraging of funds, 8 new inlets were created and 4 inlet channels were rehabilitated which brought more surface water inflows into wetlands. Improved habitats of aquatic and avian biodiversity\n• The enhanced flows and removal of weeds in specific wetlands resulted in improved concentration of dissolved oxygen which increased from 4 mg/l to 6-8 mg/l.\nThe Improvement in wetland health provided conducive habitats for aquatic species (fishes and turtles) and dependent avian fauna.\n\nInnovation: \n\nThis innovative approach tested river-wetland co-management in an aquifer-fed river system. River rejuvenation demonstrated the significance of wetland restoration in river catchments. The multi-stakeholder collaboration that led to the restoration of these wetlands is a distinguishing feature of this model, resulting in the successful rejuvenation of the Aril River. The initiative successfully integrated science, practice, and policy by adopting a whole government and multi-stakeholder approach to river rejuvenation.",

    "content": "Interventions: \n\nThe Mobile L.I.S. consists of a 3 H.P. BLDC Pumpset powered by Polycrystalline Solar Panels mounted on the same platform of 4m x 3m size. Each polycrystalline solar panel module has 335 Wp. We can also use a Mono Crystalline solar module of 530 Wp each which will allow us to install a 5 HP pump set on the same size of the floating platform.\n\nBarge Design Specification :\nSize of Platform: 4m x 3m\nLoad capacity of Barrel Barge: 3800 kg\nNumber of Barrels: 20 Nos.\nMaterial Used: MS Sheet of 5mm size, MS Angle of Assorted Size, GI Pipe, MS Flat, etc.\n\nPanel and Pump Specification:\nSolar Panel Capacity: 3000 Wp (09 nos. of Photovoltaic Cells-PVC)\nPump: 3 HP DC surface Pump (Head 18 Meter)\nDischarge: 700 LPM\nDelivery: 3 Inch\nCommand Area: 6-8 hac (From a single suction point)\nCanvas Pipe: 200 Meter\nRMS: Yes (With CCTV camera)\nMobility: Yes\n\nTheme: \nWater Use Efficiency initiatives\nPlace of implementation: \nBoko, Kamrup (R), Assam\nOrganisation / Department: \nIrrigation Department, State Govt. Of Assam\nYear of implementation: \n2023\nBackground: \n\nSolar Powered Mobile L.I.S. is a Lift Irrigation Scheme where the Pump Station can easily be moved from one position to another in need of covering the optimum command area. The pump is mounted on a platform floating using Recycled UPVC Barrels and the solar panels are also mounted on the same platform. It is cost-effective and light in weight. Using of self-priming BLDC surface pump allows it a maximum running hour in a day even on cloudy days. The introduction of IoT based Remote Monitoring System allows real-time monitoring of running hours, discharge, voltage, current, etc. It floats quite easily and it mitigates the possibility of any damage to the pump station during the flood.\nMobile L.I.S. offers advantages in terms of adaptability and water efficiency. These systems can be easily transported to different locations within the same water source. This flexibility allows farmers to respond to changing irrigation needs or varying water availability in different parts of their fields. By utilizing this approach, farmers can optimize water usage, ensuring that crops receive adequate irrigation while minimizing water wastage. The ability to move the irrigation system also makes it suitable for areas with uneven topography or where fixed infrastructure may be challenging to implement. Additionally, Mobile L.I.S. can be particularly beneficial for smallholder farmers or those with limited access to permanent irrigation facilities. It provides a cost-effective solution that doesn't require extensive investment in fixed infrastructure. Overall, mobile lift irrigation schemes offer a dynamic and resource-efficient approach to agricultural water management, contributing to sustainable farming practices.\n\nWith a vision to provide Irrigation facilities to the farmers of remote areas, Er. Akikul Aman, Assistant Executive Engineer, Irrigation (Assam) has successfully introduced a Mobile Lift Irrigation Scheme at Barbeel Lake situated in Boko under the Kamrup (M) district of Assam. The basic aim of the scheme is to supply irrigation water in larger areas with limited sources at a lower cost of construction using solar power. As the greater Boko area is full of natural water bodies, the idea of installing a Mobile scheme has been thought of so that more areas can be commanded by shifting the pump station from one location to another. On 12th August’2023, the scheme was successfully inaugurated by the Honourable Chief Engineer (I), Chief Engineer (MI) and other dignitaries of first of its kind in the Irrigation Department, Assam. It's a solar-powered pumping station that can be easily moved from one location to another, thanks to its floating barge, which is made out of recycled UPVC barrels. In addition, a new Remote Monitoring System is included, allowing for constant surveillance of the setup. It requires no human labor and can be managed from afar, making it suitable for use in even the most austere environments. The scheme is proven to be very environmentally sustainable, and cost-effective and its mobile application leads to a maximum coverage of the command area. The scheme's data can be linked directly to the IPMS portal of the Irrigation Department, Assam providing a transparent, clear image of delivery of service.\n\nObjectives: \n\nTo Reduce pumping cost per Ha and optimum utilization of surface water source at minimum cost.\n\nOutcome: \n\nWith a vision to provide Irrigation facilities to the farmers of flood-prone remote areas, where electricity facilities are not adequately available, the Mobile L.I.S. system is introduced. As it uses solar power to operate, it reduces the operational cost and also provides the liberty to shoot up its capacity to the required level. As the complete setup is flexible and modular we can easily increase its size in no time. Its mobile application allows it to pump out water from different suction points. Considering at least 3 to 4 suction points by a single pump station, the total command area will certainly be a huge one. Adding a distribution line will allow us to irrigate the optimum command area.\n\nTotal Cost of the Scheme = Rs. 8,46,700.00\n\nBCR @6% Interest =5.59\nBCR @10% Interest =4.53\nBCR @15% Interest =3.67\nNet Present Value = 3,38,15,627.00 (15 Years)\n\nFrom this, it is learned that it is very much cost-effective, with no Land Acquisition issues and we can multiply the units as per our requirement. Mobile lift irrigation schemes have proven effective on a smaller scale, there is potential for scaling up these initiatives to cover larger agricultural areas. Governments and development organizations can play a role in scaling up successful pilot projects, ensuring that the benefits of mobile lift irrigation reach a broader segment of the farming population.\n\nInnovation: \n\n1. Low Cost of Construction:\nCheaper to construct compared to MS Barge due to three major points-\ni. Use of used UPVC barrels.\nii. Fabrication can be done at the workshop. It can be transported to the location and Maneuverer is easy.\niii. No separate solar structure is needed as panels are mounted on the superstructure of the barrel barge only.\n2. Low Maintenance Cost:\ni. The LIS is powered by solar panels, so no cost of operation is there. Return on investment is fast.\nii. In case of damage replacement of barrels is easy and inexpensive.\n3. Ease of Installation\ni. The whole setup can be assembled in an hour manually at any remote place.4\n4. Modular Design:\ni. The size of the platform along with the complete setup can be increased easily according to the requirement of capacity.\n5. Eco Friendly:\ni. The use of solar panels and recycled barrels makes it eco-friendly.\n6. Theft Prevention:\ni. As we are using a DC pump instead of an AC pump it can’t be used for any domestic or industrial purpose, which makes it unattractive for thieves.\nii. Provisions are made for the installation of a Motion sensor CC camera for live monitoring of the pump station.\niii. It is proposed to provide embossed Solar Panels and Pump where it reflects\n“PROPERTY OF IRRIGATION DEPARTMENT, GOVT. OF ASSAM”\n7. Remote Monitoring System :\ni. IoT-based Remote Monitoring System installed in the Barge Pump Controller, The scheme's data can be linked directly to the INO portal, providing a transparent, clear image of the delivery of service.",

    "content": "Interventions: \n\nPHYTORID technology UWTP of capacity 1 MLD was planned and constructed by Karnataka Urban Water Supply & Drainage Board (KUWS&DB) on behalf of Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) under Atal Mission for Urban Rejuvenation & Transformation (AMRUT). The following interventions were made:\n1. The existing trunk main of capacity 4-5 MLD near the lake was tapped to draw 1 MLD used water to the proposed UWTP\n2. Construction of a decentralized UWTP of 1 MLD capacity of Phytorid technology which is system based on natural treatment methods and has distinctive advantages over conventional treatment plants. In this technology, treatment occurs via natural methods such as filtration, sedimentation, nutrient uptake by plants and microbial action in a constructed system which is filled with filter media. Specifically identified species of plants which are known to have good nutrient uptake are planted in the filter media.\n3. Re-using the treated used water after tertiary treatment by discharging into the lake as an alternative source of water to maintain the water body and bio-diversity of the lake.\n\nTheme: \nReuse of Treated Water\nPlace of implementation: \nTolanakeri, Hubballi city, Karnataka state.\nOrganisation / Department: \nKarnataka Urban Water Supply & Drainage Board.\nYear of implementation: \n2020\nBackground: \n\nTolanakeri is a lake located in Akshay Park area of Hubballi city in Dharwad district of Karnataka state which usually dried up during the summer and thereby affecting the bio-diversity of the lake and also the ground water table. Further, the Hubballi-Dharwad Smart City Limited had taken up the works of beautification of the lake and recreational facilities. Hence, there was a need to explore alternative arrangements to fill the lake with water and maintain the water level at FTL even during the summer. In this context an alternative arrangement of water source for the lake was thought by establishing a decentralized Used Water Treatment Plant (UWTP) near the lake to treat the Used Water from the surrounding areas collected through an existing sewer line and replenish the lake with treated Used Water as per KSCPB/CPCB norms. Further the Used Water Treatment Plant was required to blend into the background of the lake environment and development works of gardens.\nHence, Karnataka Urban Water Supply & Drainage Board (KUWS&DB) took up the work of construction of 1 MLD capacity Phytorid UWTP under AMRUT on the upstream side of the lake to draw used water from a nearby sewer trunk main (as a source of used water) to treat the used water and discharge the treated used water (after tertiary treatment) into the lake for replenishment of the lake.\n\nObjectives: \n\nReplenishment of Tolanakeri lake which has a capacity of about 900 ML with the following objectives:\n1. Maintain water level in the lake at FTL throughout the year.\n2. Provide alternative source of water to the lake in absence of rains.\n3. Improve the ground water table.\n4. Improvements in the bio-diversity of the lake.\n5. Improvement of recreational activities.\n\nOutcome: \n\nThe UWTP was put into operation during May 2020 and the effluent parameters are being continuously monitored which confirm to the requirements of KSPCB/CPCB. With the discharge of the treated Used Water into the lake, the water body is continuously replenished to maintain the water level of the lake at FTL even during summer. This has resulted in the following improvements:\n1. The lake never dries up due to daily discharge of about 1 ML of treated used water which maintains the water level of the lake at FTL. This has resulted in becoming an alternative source of water to the lake in absence of rains.\n2. Increased the ground water table.\n3. Recreational activities in the the lake surroundings have increased.\n4. Helped in improving the Aesthetic aura because of plants (ornamental as well as flowering).\n5. Improvements in the bio-diversity of the lake.\n\nInnovation: \n\n1. Construction of a decentralized UWTP in the vicinity of a water body/lake where usually the sewer mains are carried as per natural topography can be a potential water source for a water body/lake.\n\n2. PHYTORID TECHNOLOGY FOR USED WATER TREATMENT PLANT:\nIt is a self-sustaining technology developed by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), CSIR that works on the principle of natural wetland. It has been developed and patented by CSIR- National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR - NEERI). This technology has also obtained the authorization from Council of Scientific & Industrial Research.\nPHYTORID system is based on natural treatment methods and has distinctive advantages over conventional treatment plants. In this technology, treatment occurs via natural methods such as filtration, sedimentation, nutrient uptake by plants and microbial action in a constructed system which is filled with filter media. Specifically identified species of plants which are known to have good nutrient uptake are planted in the filter media.\nFurther, this system being a natural system operation is mostly passive and requires harvesting of roots once in 6 months and loosening of filter media once in a year. The requirement of power is also less in comparison to the electro-mechanical STPs.\nBenefits of PHYTORID system:\n Very less requirement of power\n Simple in design & operation\n Aesthetic aura because of plants (ornamental as well as flowering) and subsurface flow of water)\n No application of chemicals for treatment process\n Lower costs of treating sewage\n Increased presence of birds and other fauna\n Extra gardens and landscaping features not required for beautification\n More diverse biota",

    "content": "Interventions: \n\nFor this initiative, all 136 panchayats of 11 blocks of Buxar district were targeted to rejuvenate the local environment and foster community involvement. This initiative is being implemented through a series of well-coordinated schemes, involving MGNREGA, Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Mission and others with the coordination of school students, local communities, and Jeevika Didis, among others.\nIn schools, environmental education programs are integrated into the curriculum to raise awareness among students about the importance of afforestation. School-based tree planting drives are organised, where students actively participate in planting and nurturing seedlings within school premises and designated community areas. These activities not only instil a sense of responsibility towards the environment in young minds but also create green spaces that enhance the local landscape. In Swacchta Hi Sewa Campaign, District Ganga Committee of Buxar organised special campaign in colleges and schools to reiterate key responsibility of youths in plantation drives. In MV College, which is a prominent College in the urban area of Buxar, many Officers interacted with students and discussed the importance of afforestation. National Mission for Clean Ganga collaborated with youths associated with Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan for an awareness drive to keep Buxar green. They took an oath to plant a sapling. In these campaigns ward councillors, media personnel and mother people representatives take part to make these campaigns more successful.\n\nIn Rajpur, Chausa Chaugain, Brahmpur and Chakki blocks, plants were distributed in 165 schools by collaboration between Ganga Samiti and the Forest Department. In 159 Middle and High Schools of Buxar, Youth and Eco clubs are functional. In a year, they organise awareness campaigns for neighbourhood on Republic Day, Independence day, National Youth Day etc. They organise debate, quiz and cultural events by engaging with family and community. Students came with placards written with their name and roll numbers. They fixed these placards beside their adopted plants and pledged to take care of them. So, it was not a one-time drive, innovation was at the stage of making this drive regular and sustainable. It is ensured that periodic Meetings of Van Poshakh, teachers-students, Jeevika Didis are held.\n\nLocal communities are at the heart of this afforestation effort. With the contribution of Mukhiya, Sarpanch and other local bodies, village panchayats are engaged through participatory planning sessions to identify suitable lands for afforestation and select appropriate tree species that are native and beneficial to the local ecosystem and people. The involvement of local farmers and landowners ensures that the planted trees are maintained and protected. Training sessions on sustainable agricultural practices and the benefits of agroforestry are conducted by Krishi Vigyan Kendra, to encourage the integration of trees into farming systems, thereby enhancing both environmental and economic resilience.\n\nJeevika Didis, women's self-help groups (SHGs), play a pivotal role in this initiative. Leveraging their strong community networks, Jeevika Didis lead village-level campaigns to mobilise residents, particularly women, to participate in tree planting and care activities. These SHGs are also provided with training on nursery management, enabling them to produce and supply quality saplings for the afforestation efforts. The active involvement of women not only ensures the success of the project but also empowers them economically and socially, as they take on leadership roles within their communities.\n\nThe district administration supports these efforts through various government schemes and programs, such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and through the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Department. These schemes provided financial and technical assistance for large-scale tree planting activities, creating employment opportunities and ensuring the sustainability of the project. District Magistrate of Buxar spearheaded plantation drives along Dalsagar, Hethua, Pokharahan and Bijhaura panchayat etc. by planting many saplings. Additionally, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are put in place to track the progress and impact of the afforestation efforts, ensuring accountability and continuous improvement. Other senior district-level and block level officers took part in plantation drives in different parts of subdivisions and blocks. They all helped in spreading the message of sustainability of plants. Hence, by leveraging the collective efforts of students, local communities, and Jeevika Didis, the Buxar district aims to transform its panchayats into thriving green zones. This comprehensive intervention not only addresses environmental degradation but also fosters a culture of sustainability and community stewardship. \"Intensive Afforestation for a Sustainable Future\" serves as a model for grassroots environmental action, demonstrating how collaborative efforts can lead to significant ecological and socio-economic benefits.\n\nTheme: \nIntensive Afforestation\nPlace of implementation: \nDistrict - Buxar, State - Bihar\nOrganisation / Department: \nThe Office of the District Magistrate, district - Buxar, Government of Bihar\nYear of implementation: \n2024\nBackground: \n\n\"Intensive Afforestation for a Sustainable Future\" is an ambitious environmental initiative aimed at addressing the escalating impacts of deforestation, climate change, and biodiversity loss. In Bihar, Buxar district faced severe challenges due to extreme heat wave conditions, with temperatures soaring to 47-48°C, slightly higher than the previous year. This drastic rise has impacted daily life and health of common people through heat waves. It was analysed that in earlier plantation drives a considerable number of saplings did not develop into trees, due to lack of proper maintenance and regular monitoring. So, negligence towards plants after investing resources, energy and time in plantation drives led to limited effectiveness. It was a major challenge before district administration to make a sustained plantation where saplings complete their life cycles and grow as trees. Hence, now in already ongoing plantation and afforestation schemes, an element of attachment with plants is required to be added. That is why, collaboration of different plantation schemes along with active participation of people in plantation drives had to be ensured.\n\nObjectives: \n\nThe initiative focuses on the sustainability of large-scale planting of native and resilient tree species on degraded land, along different Pokhar banks, in schools, hospital premises, etc. to reclaim degraded land as well as to improve green cover in Buxar. This initiative also aims to rejuvenate ecosystems and promote sustainable land management practices by engaging local communities, school students, Jeevika didi’s, public representatives and others by executing different governmental schemes i.e., MGNREGA, Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Mission, National Mission for Clean Ganga, National Rural Livelihood Mission etc. to foster a collaborative approach towards intensive afforestation. It emphasises the importance of biodiversity, soil conservation, and water management as key elements in creating resilient landscapes. The objective is to engage local communities in the afforestation process. This initiative provides employment opportunities, promotes sustainable agricultural practices, and empowers communities to take ownership of their local environment. Through educational campaigns and community involvement, the initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of afforestation and environmental conservation. It aims to inspire individuals and organisations to actively participate in and support afforestation efforts. The initiative emphasises on the importance of planting a variety of tree species to support diverse habitats. This approach helps in preserving and enhancing local biodiversity, ensuring the survival of various plant and animal species i.e., Black-buck, etc. Additionally, it improves the quality of air in urban areas, provides people with home grown chemical-less fruits and improves groundwater table. The initiative demands a multi-faceted approach to ensure broad participation and true efforts to maximise survival of these plants.\nSo, all of the above-mentioned objectives can only be ensured only if the plants develop into trees and sustain its growth. Therefore, the whole district administration focused on involving people who will adopt these plants and ensure its development.\n\nOutcome: \n\nThe \"Intensive Afforestation for a Sustainable Future\" initiative in the Buxar district has yielded significant positive outcomes, transformed the local environment, and strengthened community bonds. Through the active participation of school students, local communities, and Jeevika Didis, the project successfully planted Five lakhs and fifteen thousand trees across various panchayats, restoring degraded lands and creating new green spaces. This large-scale afforestation effort has enhanced local biodiversity, improved soil health, and increased water retention, contributing to greater climate resilience in the district.\nA new trend has been established where there is regular meeting of students-teachers, Jeevika Didis and Van Poshaks where they assess the survivability of plants that have been planted. They plan a strategy to improve the probability of sustainable growth. Additionally, the initiative has empowered local women and fostered environmental stewardship among youth, creating a lasting cultural shift towards sustainability. The involvement of Jeevika Didis in nursery management and tree care has provided economic opportunities for women, boosting their income and leadership roles. Overall, the initiative has contributed to environmental restoration and strengthened community cohesion, making Buxar a model for sustainable rural development.\n\nInnovation: \n\nThe innovation behind Buxar district adopting this initiative lies in constant monitoring of maintenance of plants for its sustainable growth. The focus was on the sustainability of the lifespan of a plant from saplings to a full grown tree. District Magistrate formed a team of Senior officers and made them in-charge of different blocks for plantation drives. This team headed by District Magistrate planted many saplings at various public spaces and promoted public participation for maintenance and care of growing saplings. This team focused on sending an important message among people about the criticality of supporting plants to gain a certain height and strength that would help them to self-sustain. Fencing using bamboo or metal gavian or barbed wire was ensured where it was possible. Another innovation was to make intensive afforestation a community-centric approach, integrating local schools students, Jeevika Didis, and panchayats to drive large-scale tree planting efforts. By combining environmental education with hands-on involvement, the initiative leverages local knowledge and social networks, particularly through women-led SHGs, and school children to ensure sustainable tree care and economic empowerment. Additionally, the use of government schemes like MGNREGA and Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Mission for funding and monitoring ensures accountability and long-term success, making it a replicable model for other regions.",
